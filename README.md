Howdy! This program allows people to take animations or movie clips, and convert them to proffie OLED animations.
It currently runs on python 3.12.3 --on windows this is the same one in the microsoft store

Supported video formats are AVI, MP4, MKV, MOV, MPEG, WMV, FLV, ASF. There is also more, but that's the main gist of it.

There is a time limit to the videos, I'm not sure what it is but I think around 2 minutes long and you're proffie will run out of memory.

When running the program, you can either double click on it, or execute from terminal.
Copy and paste the video file path into the terminal, being sure there's no quatations surrounding it, and it matches the format of the example.

The dithering method uses floyd-steinberg, and you can also choose no dithering if you'd like no shading.

A good example of when to use no shading is after making a plain unshaded text animation in after effects, and wanting to render that out as a proffie image.
You should use dithering for the majority of movie clips however.
